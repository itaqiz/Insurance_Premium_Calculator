# Insurance Premium Calculator 💰📊

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Insurance Premium Calculator project! This project aims to provide users with accurate estimates of insurance premiums based on various personal factors. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, our application delivers reliable predictions to empower individuals in making informed decisions about their insurance coverage.

## Introduction
Calculating insurance premiums is a complex and critical process in the insurance industry. Our project enhances the existing premium calculation capabilities by implementing state-of-the-art machine learning models. This allows us to provide users with more accurate and personalized premium estimates, enabling them to make well-informed decisions about their insurance needs.

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or a higher version installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the `insurance.csv` dataset and place it in the project directory.
4. You're now ready to use the Insurance Premium Calculator! Proceed to the [Usage](#usage) section for instructions.

## Usage
To use the Insurance Premium Calculator, simply provide the following personal information:

- Age
- Gender
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Smoking status
- Geographic region

The application will then leverage the trained machine learning models to estimate your insurance premium. The results will be displayed in a user-friendly format, allowing you to make informed decisions about your insurance coverage.

## Data Sources
The Insurance Premium Calculator is built upon the `insurance.csv` dataset, which contains relevant insurance data. This dataset was carefully curated and preprocessed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the machine learning models.

## Dependencies
The Insurance Premium Calculator project relies on the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and will be automatically installed during the setup process.

## Model Performance
Our machine learning models have achieved an impressive R-squared score of 0.85, indicating strong predictive performance. This level of accuracy ensures that the Insurance Premium Calculator provides users with reliable and trustworthy premium estimates.
